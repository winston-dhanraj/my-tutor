       "In Python, both lists and tuples are used to store collections of items. However, they have several important differences that affect how they can be used in a program. Below are the key distinctions between lists and tuples:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Mutability**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **List**: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify them after their creation. You can add, remove, or change items in a list.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  python\n",
       "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
       "  my_list[1] = 5  # Changing the second element\n",
       "  my_list.append(4)  # Adding a new element\n",
       "  print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 3, 4]\n",
       "  \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tuple**: Tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, you cannot change their contents. You cannot add or remove items from a tuple.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  python\n",
       "  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
       "  # my_tuple[1] = 5  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
       "  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Syntax**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **List**: Lists are created using square brackets `[]`.\n",
       "\n",
       "  python\n",
       "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
       "  \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tuple**: Tuples are created using parentheses `()`.\n",
       "\n",
       "  python\n",
       "  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
       "  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Performance**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **List**: Lists have more overhead associated with their dynamic resizing, and they are generally slower than tuples.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tuple**: Tuples are more memory efficient and have a slight performance advantage since they are immutable. This can lead to faster access times.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Use Cases**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **List**: Commonly used when you need a collection of items that may change throughout the lifecycle of the program, such as a list of user inputs or a collection of items that needs to grow or shrink.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tuple**: Typically used for fixed collections of items, such as coordinates (x, y), RGB values, or when you need to return multiple values from a function.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Functions and Methods**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **List**: Lists come with many built-in methods such as `append()`, `remove()`, `extend()`, and `pop()` that enable modification.\n",
       "\n",
       "  python\n",
       "  my_list.remove(2)  # Removes the first occurrence of 2\n",
       "  \n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tuple**: Tuples have fewer built-in methods. You can use methods like `count()` and `index()`, but you cannot modify the tuple.\n",
       "\n",
       "  python\n",
       "  print(my_tuple.count(1))  # Outputs the number of occurrences of 1\n",
       "  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. **Hashability**\n",
       "\n",
       "- **List**: Lists are not hashable, which means they cannot be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Tuple**: Tuples are hashable (as long as they contain only hashable elements) and can therefore be used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Example\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a brief comparison in code:\n",
       "\n",
       "python\n",
       "# List example\n",
       "list_example = [1, 2, 3]\n",
       "list_example.append(4)  # Modify list\n",
       "print(list_example)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
       "\n",
       "# Tuple example\n",
       "tuple_example = (1, 2, 3)\n",
       "# tuple_example.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError\n",
       "print(tuple_example)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, lists are mutable, ordered collections enclosed in square brackets, while tuples are immutable, ordered collections enclosed in parentheses. The choice between using a list or a tuple depends on whether you need a collection that can change or one that should remain constant."

       "\n",
       "*   `book.get(\"author\")`: For each book object (`book`), this selects the \"value\" associated with the key `\"author\"` in that book's dictionary representation. The `.get()` method is used instead of `.keys()`, `.values()`, or `.items()`, as it allows us to specify a default value if the key doesn't exist.\n",

       "*   `for book in books`: This specifies our iterator over a collection of book objects (`books`).\n",
       "\n",
       "*   `if book.get(\"author\")`: We include only those books where there exists an `\"author\"` in the dictionary representation. The `.get()` method will return `None`, which is considered \"falsy,\" so it wouldn't appear in our iteration.\n",
